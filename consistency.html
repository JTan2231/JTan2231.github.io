        <ul>
            <li>An absolute consistency all throughout a system is what makes it perform optimally<ul>
                    <li>Interests you have that are consistent throughout life are reflective of the manner in which you

                        be consistent<ul>
                            <li>Reflective of the invariant of your character/personality, i.e. &quot;who you are&quot;

                    <li>This is often attempted at scale with companies -- an example of consistency within organization

                            <li>To make social consistency happen in an organization is the purpose of a leader --
                                &quot;This is
                                how all of you should behave, and I am why.&quot;<ul>
                                    <li>This can&#39;t be comprehensive, think it needs a separate essay
                                </ul>

                            <li>If something doesn&#39;t fit the form (i.e. if something is inconsistent with the rest
                                of the
                                process) then it will stick out/not feel right
                        </ul>

                    <li>&quot;Catching the vibe&quot; as a means of understanding process<ul>
                            <li>Learning how to do this is probably the best way of approaching uncertainty (i.e. life)

                    <li>Doing what feels right as a metric for measuring how consistent you are<ul>
                            <li>If your habits/system/process is good, then it will feel good to follow your impulse --
                                things
                                will just function &quot;better&quot;
