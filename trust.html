        <h1>Trust</h1>
        <p>
            To do:
        <ul>
            <li>All human actions are founded on trust
                <ul>
                    <li>Humans are fundamentally communal, and trust is foundational to such cooperation
                    <li>This feels shaky at best
                </ul>
            <li>The interpersonal
                <ul>
                    <li>In catering to another we are vying for their trust?
                    <li>What makes confidence attractive (i.e. "the nature of cool")
                    <li>Everything (interpersonal interactions, signaling, etc. i.e. communication) as an invitation to
                        trust
                        <ul>
                            <li>Components of a conversation (small talk, catching up, sharing one's day, etc.)
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            <li>Object level
                <ul>
                    <li>Not sure about this one, probably an extension of the interpersonal
                </ul>
            <li>Religion/faith
                <ul>
                    <li>??? There's gotta be something here
                    <li>Faith in the abstract framework ("the method") which binds one to their chosen community?
                    <li>Faith in the method which reliably connects one to their chosen community?
                </ul>
        </ul>
