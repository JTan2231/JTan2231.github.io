how can we programmatically browse the internet?

i need you to:
- browse through these pages (under index.html) where you are able using playwright/something similar

in service of:
- writing a biographical llms.txt about who i am, what i do, how i think, and what i work on

use bun in place of anything npm, and use ts as your preferred script

please be very detailed--a few lines on each point that you dig into

this document should be optimized for clarifying density--while, yes, it's fundamentally a reduction of the work, it should provide a clear picture of who i am in terms of my work rather than just standard blanket terms
