# llms.txt - Joey Tan

## Identity
Joey Tan is a software engineer (from the site index) and writes as "joey tan" on Substack.
GitHub shows the username JTan2231 with a broad set of repositories and ongoing contributions.
The LinkedIn public preview (sign-in gated) lists Nashville, Tennessee, United States and
an association with Jackson, but the full profile details are not publicly visible.

## Work focus: legibility
He is preoccupied with making ideas legible, not just writing them down. In his essay
"Legibility," he highlights how ideas fail to land because of framing, timing, and missing
feedback loops, and how these failure modes are hard to diagnose. The throughline is a drive
to make meaning explicit and actionable, especially under real-world time pressure.

## Product: Stet
Stet is a workspace for writers who want clear feedback without ghostwriting. The product
positions itself as getting notes on structure, clarity, and argument, rather than rewriting
the work itself. It also stresses privacy and control: content is not used to train AI models,
and users can decide what is saved and what the AI can see.

## Prompt design mindset
He frames prompts as a workspace that defines the AI's world, not just a question to ask.
He contrasts blank chat interfaces with integrated environments like Cursor, where the AI
shares files, tools, and context with the user. For him, the leverage is in coherent world-
building: clear boundaries, shared artifacts, and predictable handles for action.

## Policy drafting as engineering leverage
He argues that as code generation gets easier, the skill premium shifts from syntax to policy
drafting. He likens prompt and documentation work to organizational governance: structured
English that constrains agents' behavior in systems with real consequences. He stresses that
precise terminology and comprehensive documentation are essential to keep fast-moving, agent-
assisted development from destabilizing systems.

## Engineering footprint
GitHub lists 73 repositories and a pinned Rust project, `vizier`, described as "a configurable
agent development workflow." He also contributes to `castra` and `castrum`, suggesting a cluster
of agent- or infra-oriented projects. The activity graph shows heavy commit volume over the last
year, reinforcing an active builder profile.

## Other project: Annals
Annals appears as a web app that recaps activity over selectable windows (days/weeks/months/
years) and connects to GitHub. The public view is minimal, but the UI implies a focus on
reflective summaries of activity. It aligns with his broader interest in feedback loops and
legibility over time.

## Writing voice
His essays use concrete scenarios (party conversations, coworker emails, editing struggles)
to surface abstract problems in communication and tooling. He blends product thinking with
system design analogies, moving between human collaboration and agent constraints. The tone
is analytical but practical, aimed at diagnosing why ideas fail to land and how interfaces can
make them land more reliably.
